# learning-react-game-app
This is the final exercise for learning React 18 from [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/). My goals for this 
course were learning the fundamentals of React and Typescript. Some items I do wish he had touched on more were 
coding best practices and commenting code correctly.
