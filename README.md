# learning-react-game-app
This is the final exercise for learning React 18 from [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/). My goals for this 
course were learning the fundamentals of React and Typescript. Some items I do wish he had touched on more were 
coding best practices and commenting code correctly. The biggest missing part from a quality standpoint is that there 
are no comments. If this were production code, please trust that it would be heavily commented, and fully conform to 
Typescript standards.

There are issues with this code, but since it's the result of the course I didn't address them. There are two important 
ones I want to address for anyone looking at this repository.

1. No comments. Well commented code can be one of the biggest tools in an engineers toolbox. If this was intended for
   production, everything would be thoroughly commented.
2. No unit tests. Again, this is a course final exercise, so there are no unit tests. Anything going to production 
   should be unit tested.
